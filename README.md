# Computervision_VW
This GitHub repository consists of two components: Python code and a Vectorworks (VW) script. The Python code detects hand positions, finger movements, and screen proximity. Upon opening Vectorworks, the included VW script, implemented with Marionette, processes the collected data to create a point attractor. This attractor facilitates dynamic design adjustments within the Vectorworks environment based on the captured input.
