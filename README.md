# Computervision_VW
This code was design in two parts: One in Python and one in Vectorworks. The Python code allows to detect hand position / finger movement; as well as proximity with the screen. Once we open VW, there is a short script in Marionette that allows to translate this previous information into a point attractor, that can affect the design
